# Analysing data with R # 
Data is growing at a very fast rate.
And so are the ways in which data is being tapped by businesses,industries, institutions, and governments, all over the world,for making decisions that guide their future and the future of the
people they serve.How much value we can derive from data really depends on just two things – the accuracy of data and the efficiency with which we’re able to access the data we need,
when we need it.But you might ask, "Why should I learn data analysis?”You use data analysis to derive value from data.With data analysis, you can firstly predict data trends,
analyze and interpret data in meaningful ways.And, finally and most importantly,it solves the problem and drives effective decision-making in real-world scenarios.
So, who is this course for?This course is for people who want to become a data analyst or a data scientist.This course starts with a question and then walksyou through the process of
answering it through data.You will first learn important techniques for preparing your data for analysis.You will then learn how to gain a better understanding of your data
through exploratory data analysis, helping you to summarize your data and identify relevant relationships between variables that can lead to insights.Once your data is ready to analyze,
you will learn how to develop your model and evaluate and tune its performance.By following this process, you can be sure that your data analysis performs to the standards that you have set,
and you can have confidence in the results.In this course, we'll use a real-world data from the Data Asset eXchange.
DAX offers high-quality datasets with clearly defined data licenses on the IBM Developer website.We will use the airline dataset from DAX throughout this course
